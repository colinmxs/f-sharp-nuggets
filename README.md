I set out to solve the ever-pervasive question: How many right angles are formed between hands on a three-handed clockface?

Using the equation t = b / (x - y), t represents the amount of time (in minutes) it will take for the hands of a clock to form the given angle b. 
x = the number of degrees the faster hand moves per second.
y = the number of degrees the slower hand moves per second.
